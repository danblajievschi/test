    <h1>Cape Town</h1>
    <p>Cape Town is the second-most populous city in South Africa, after Johannesburg, and also the legislative capital of South Africa. Colloquially named the Mother City, it is the largest city of the Western Cape province and forms part of the City of Cape Town metropolitan municipality. The Parliament of South Africa is situated in Cape Town. The other two capitals are located in Gauteng (Pretoria the executive capital where the Presidency is based) and in the Free State (Bloemfontein the judicial capital where the Supreme Court of Appeal is located). The city is known for its harbour, for its natural setting in the Cape Floristic Region, and for landmarks such as Table Mountain and Cape Point. Cape Town is home to 49% of the Western Cape's population. The city was named the World Design Capital for 2014 by the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design.

In 2014, Cape Town was named the best place in the world to visit by both The New York Times and The Daily Telegraph. Cape Town has also been a host city for both the 1995 Rugby World Cup and 2010 FIFA World Cup, and annually hosts the Africa leg of the World Rugby 7s.

Located on the shore of Table Bay, Cape Town, as the oldest urban area in South Africa, it was developed by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) as a supply station for Dutch ships sailing to East Africa, India, and the Far East. Jan van Riebeeck's arrival on 6 April 1652 established the VOC Cape Colony, the first permanent European settlement in South Africa. Cape Town outgrew its original purpose as the first European outpost at the Castle of Good Hope, becoming the economic and cultural hub of the Cape Colony. Until the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the development of Johannesburg, Cape Town was the largest city in South Africa.</p>

<h1>Weather</h1>
<p>Cape Town has a Mediterranean-style climate: wet and cool winters, dry and warm summers. The annual average temperature in Cape Town is a delightful 17 degrees.

As in the city of Cape Town itself, the weather on the Cape Peninsula is quite unique. The weather in Cape Town is influenced by two currents: the warm Agulhas current from the Indian Ocean side and the cold Benguela current on the Atlantic side.

Tourists flock to Cape Town during summer, but don’t let the word ‘winter’ scare you away. Winters in Cape Town are not like winters in Germany, Holland or England. Imagine a spring day in London, Amsterdam or Berlin. That’s what winters are like in Cape Town. Sometimes windy and rainy, mostly soft and breezy.</P>

<h1>Activities</h1>
<P>Magic gardens, hidden play parks, waterfalls and a castle. Celebrate  South African art and heritage museums, including one dedicated to southern Africa's oldest inhabitants. Plus find once-in-a-lifetime adventures and things to do across the Western Cape. Local or visitor, you must add one (if not all) of these experiences to your bucket list.</P>

<h1>Food</h1>
<P>Cape Town has a unique multi-cultural heritage that influences much of its cuisine. There are few dishes or foods that stand alone as “traditional.” Rather, you’ll find a mix of styles, flavors, and techniques—from Cape Dutch to French and Indian. And though not traditional, dishes like sushi are also top quality.</P>

<h1>Here is the food you should be eating in Cape Town</h1>
<H2> 1. FISH AND CHIPS </H2>
<P>
Cape Town’s proximity to flourishing oceans and history of British colonial rule has resulted in a vibrant fish and chips culture. This reveals itself in various forms—from casual street food style eateries and hole-in-the-wall hatches serving up deep-fried fish and chips through to high-end line fish served at top restaurants. Most fish served in Cape Town is fresh and worth exploring. If you want to keep it traditional, head to a specialist fish and chips shop, preferably by the ocean, and order a portion of deep-fried hake or snoek with chips. Kalky’s in Kalk Bay and Snoekies in Hout Bay are two original shops to visit. It may not be the healthiest option, but it’s tasty, cheap, and the perfect accompaniment to a day by the sea.</P>

<H2> 2. BUNNY CHOW </H2>
<P>Bunny Chow is a classic South African meal that draws on the country’s Indian influence. It’s a filling fast food dish that is essentially half a loaf of hollowed out bread filled with curry. The meat is usually beef or chicken, and aside from the unusual name has nothing to do with rabbit. Like the gatsby, few people manage an entire portion, so it might be safer starting out with a quarter loaf, or kota. Some restaurants in the city have made an attempt at making gourmet versions of this casual dining meal, though you’re better off getting this at a no-frills takeaway joint.</P>

<H2> 3. BOBOTIE </H2>
<P>Bobotie (pronounced buh-boor-tea) is a Cape Malay creation consisting of minced beef topped with a custard of milk and eggs. It’s a fragrant dish flavored with spices and dried fruit. The result is sweet and sour flavors, with a hint of spice. Bobotie dates back to the 17th century when Indonesian slaves were brought to Cape Town, bringing with them their way of cooking. You’ll find this on several restaurant menus throughout the city, and it’s a particularly comforting meal on a cold winter’s night.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="3.bobootie_2.jpg"></P>
<H2> 4. SUSHI </H2>
<P>Sushi may not have the historical roots of other traditional dishes, but the city and its chefs have taken to it with gusto. These days you’ll find sushi on most high-end restaurant menus, and there are dozens of noteworthy sushi spots throughout the city. Though not always true to the traditional Japanese style and techniques, the unique spin on the dish, as well as its competitive pricing compared to other tourist destinations, make this a meal worth seeking out in the city.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="4.sushi-2541472_1280.jpg"></P>
<H2> 5. BILTONG AND DROEWORS </H2>
<P>Less a dish and more a snack, this is the staple bar or road trip food in many South African diets. Biltong and droëwors are made by drying meat and adding a special blend of spices. Biltong is simply cured and dried, and then sliced or left in solid sticks. Droëwors is essentially a dried sausage. Though on paper both sound slightly bizarre, most meat eaters consider them as addictive snacks. You’ll find biltong and droëwors of varying quality in all supermarkets and as snacks at some pubs, bars, and restaurants.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="5.BIL.jpg"></P>
<H2> 6. TRADITIONAL DESSERTS </H2>
<P>There are a handful of traditional sweet treats worth seeking out to round off your meal. Milk tart, malva pudding, and koeksisters will keep most people with a sweet tooth satisfied. Though these started out as traditional recipes made in local kitchens, you’ll find them in various iterations in bakeries, supermarkets, and on many restaurant menus.</P>
